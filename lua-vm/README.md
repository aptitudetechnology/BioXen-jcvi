Comparison: subprocess vs. lupa (Embedding)

The fundamental difference lies in where the Lua VM resides:

    lupa (Embedding): The Lua VM is initialized within the same Python process. This allows for very fast, direct calls between Python and Lua functions and seamless data exchange because they share the same memory space. It's ideal for tight integration where performance of cross-language calls is critical.

    subprocess (External Process): The Lua VM runs as a completely separate process. Communication happens via inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, typically standard input/output streams. This provides greater isolation and doesn't require specific binding libraries like lupa, but data transfer and function calls are inherently slower due to the overhead of process communication.

In summary, if you need tight integration and high-performance data exchange between Python and Lua, embedding with lupa is generally the superior choice. If you need process isolation, want to avoid external Python dependencies, or are simply executing existing Lua scripts as standalone tools, then the subprocess method is a viable and often simpler approach.
