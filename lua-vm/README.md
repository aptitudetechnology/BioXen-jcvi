Comparison: subprocess vs. lupa (Embedding)

The fundamental difference lies in where the Lua VM resides:

    lupa (Embedding): The Lua VM is initialized within the same Python process. This allows for very fast, direct calls between Python and Lua functions and seamless data exchange because they share the same memory space. It's ideal for tight integration where performance of cross-language calls is critical.

    subprocess (External Process): The Lua VM runs as a completely separate process. Communication happens via inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, typically standard input/output streams. This provides greater isolation and doesn't require specific binding libraries like lupa, but data transfer and function calls are inherently slower due to the overhead of process communication.

In summary, if you need tight integration and high-performance data exchange between Python and Lua, embedding with lupa is generally the superior choice. If you need process isolation, want to avoid external Python dependencies, or are simply executing existing Lua scripts as standalone tools, then the subprocess method is a viable and often simpler approach.


How Lua VMs Can Talk to Each Other

Here are the primary methods to achieve inter-VM communication, moving from simpler to more robust:

1. Standard I/O (Pipes) with subprocess.Popen

This is an extension of what you're already doing with subprocess, but instead of subprocess.run() (which waits for completion), you'd use subprocess.Popen() to keep the Lua process running and interact with its standard input and output streams.

    How it works:

        You launch each Lua VM using subprocess.Popen(), redirecting its stdin, stdout, and stderr to pipes that your Python application can read from and write to.

        Your Python application acts as a central "router" or "mediator." It reads messages from one Lua VM's stdout and then writes those messages to another Lua VM's stdin.

        The Lua scripts themselves would need to print() messages to send them and read from io.read() to receive them.

    Example Scenario: Imagine two Lua VMs, "VM1" and "VM2."

        Python starts VM1: p1 = subprocess.Popen(['lua', '-i'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

        Python starts VM2: p2 = subprocess.Popen(['lua', '-i'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

        VM1 prints a message: print("Hello from VM1")

        Python reads "Hello from VM1" from p1.stdout.

        Python writes "Hello from VM1" to p2.stdin.

        VM2 reads "Hello from VM1" from its io.read().

    Pros: Relatively simple to set up for basic text-based communication.

    Cons:

        Text-based: All communication is strings, requiring parsing.

        Blocking I/O: Managing multiple pipes can become complex if not handled asynchronously (e.g., using select or asyncio in Python).

        Mediator required: Python is always in the middle, routing messages. Direct peer-to-peer isn't native.

2. Sockets (Network Communication)

This is a more robust and flexible approach, especially if you want true peer-to-peer communication or if your Lua VMs might eventually run on different machines.

    How it works:

        Each Lua VM would need a Lua socket library (like LuaSocket).

        One Lua VM (or a dedicated Python process) could act as a server, listening on a specific port.

        Other Lua VMs would act as clients, connecting to the server.

        Once connected, they can send and receive structured data (e.g., JSON strings) over the network.

        Python can also participate as a client or server, facilitating communication or acting as a central hub.

    Example Scenario:

        Python starts VM1 (Server):
        Lua

-- VM1_server.lua
local socket = require("socket")
local server = socket.bind("*", 8080) -- Listen on all interfaces, port 8080
print("VM1: Server listening on port 8080")
local client = server:accept() -- Wait for a client to connect
print("VM1: Client connected!")
local data = client:receive()
print("VM1 received:", data)
client:send("Hello from VM1 server!")
client:close()
server:close()

Python starts VM2 (Client):
Lua

        -- VM2_client.lua
        local socket = require("socket")
        local client = socket.connect("localhost", 8080)
        print("VM2: Connected to server.")
        client:send("Hello from VM2 client!")
        local response = client:receive()
        print("VM2 received:", response)
        client:close()

        Your create_lua_vm (or a new function) would launch these Lua scripts using subprocess.Popen().

    Pros:

        Structured data: Can send and receive more complex data formats (e.g., JSON).

        Two-way communication: Sockets are inherently bidirectional.

        Scalable: Can work across networks and handle multiple connections.

        True peer-to-peer potential: Lua VMs can directly connect to each other without Python always mediating, once the initial connections are established.

    Cons:

        Requires a Lua socket library to be installed and available to the Lua interpreter.

        More complex to implement due to network programming concepts (server/client roles, error handling, connection management).

Other Advanced IPC Methods (More Complex)

    Named Pipes (FIFOs): Similar to standard I/O pipes but persistent on the filesystem. Allow unrelated processes to communicate.

    Shared Memory: Fastest method, but most complex to manage, as it requires careful synchronization to prevent data corruption.

    Message Queues (e.g., ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ): For more sophisticated messaging patterns, often used in distributed systems. These would involve a separate message broker process.

For your BioXen-jcvi project, if you're looking for simple, occasional communication between Lua processes, Standard I/O with subprocess.Popen might be a good starting point. If you envision more complex, real-time interactions or a true "peer-like" network of Lua VMs, then Sockets with LuaSocket would be the way to go.
