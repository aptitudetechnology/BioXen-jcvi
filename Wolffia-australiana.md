Additional Information on the Genome

The sequenced genome of Wolffia australiana is significant because it's the world's smallest flowering plant. Research has shown that its genome is streamlined, with a reduced set of genes compared to other flowering plants, particularly those associated with root development and defense mechanisms. This unique genetic makeup is believed to be a key factor in its rapid growth and minimal body plan

Wolffia australiana is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. Its taxonomy is as follows:
